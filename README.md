Set up a web server, such as Nginx or Apache, to serve the application.

Configure the necessary DNS settings to point your domain name to the server.

Set up a process manager, such as Gunicorn, to manage the Django application process.

Collect and compress static files:

shell
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
Restart the web server and ensure the application is running in the production environment.
